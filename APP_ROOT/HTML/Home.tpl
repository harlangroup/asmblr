    <h1>And done!</h1>
    <p>You've successfully installed the PHP Boilerplate with Framewire.</p>
</div>

This boilerplate is for designers, junior developers and masters for getting sites spun-up and ready to go quickly.  It'll grow with the development process, too - prototype, beta, production.

You don't want to always reinvent the wheel, but you don't want to learn a complex framework either.  Boilerplate is a well formed starting point for building these applications, without the tediousness of starting from scracth each time, or the learning curve and rigidness of a complex framework.

- save time
- start with proven techniques
- quickly customize as needed - no steep learning curve

Or, we've even taken care of the operating system and stack setup - spin up one of your own EC2 instance with everything pre-installed, optimized and ready to go!


<p>Now you're ready to start building modern custom sites using the
latest web technology.  This PHP boilerplate integrates HTML 5 Boilerplate, Twitter
Bootstrap (jasny) and jQuery, all cleaned-up and ready to go with the powerful Framewire PHP backend.</p>

<p>This fully functioning application includes best practices and example code
you can use, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Clean, lean and HTML 5, CSS 3, responsive, mobile and web standard.</li>
    <li>jQuery, Ajax, JSON form validation and HTML fragments.</li>
    <li>Mongo, MySQL and SQL Server connections, querying and CRUD.</li>
    <li>Throwing and handling exceptions and errors.</li>
    <li>Debugging and console logging with integrated ChromePHP and FirePHP support.</li>
    <li>Dynamic CSS and Javascript support.</li>
    <li>UTF-8 encoding and output compression.</li>
</ul>

<p>We give you the code, and the techniques, for building a modern application in no time.</p>

<p>All with github.com glory, fully documented and PageSpeed approved code.</p>

<p>Use it to learn modern web development techniques, or as a base
to quickly build out your own sites.</p>
